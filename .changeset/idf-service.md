Run ESP-IDF in its own `idf` compose service (the official `espressif/idf` image running `idf-worker.py`) instead of bundling it in the app image, which is now a small Node image. Build workers are set up by the admin on the new admin page (`/admin`) instead of with `IDF_PATH`, `IDF_PYTHON` and `MAX_WORKSPACES`: add several workers (`idf-worker.py` URLs or local ESP-IDF checkouts) to build in parallel. Builds can't be started until a worker is enabled. After upgrading, add the `idf` service there as a worker (`http://idf:3001`).
